# AI Personal Executive Assistant — OpenEnv Environment

## The Problem

Real AI assistants are trained on fixed priority rules. But real humans switch contexts constantly — a startup founder, a corporate VP, and a board-level executive handle the same email completely differently. The correct action depends not just on the email, but on *who you are and what world you're in.*

This environment tests whether an LLM can detect and adapt to **silently changing rules** — without being told the rules changed. Every 10 episodes, the priority schema switches. The agent must figure out the new rules from reward signals alone.

**This is schema drift. It's what makes this environment genuinely hard.**

**Theme:** 3.2 — World Modeling (Personalized Tasks)

## Results

### Training Progress — Reward Improved During Fine-Tuning

![train/rewards/reward_fn/mean — x: training step (0→500), y: mean reward per batch](./wandb_reward_fn_mean.png)

*`train/rewards/reward_fn/mean` over 500 GRPO training steps. Reward trends upward from ~0.28 → ~0.42+. The environment's live reward function was the only training signal — no human labels, no reward model. [Full WandB run](https://wandb.ai/kanishkjoshi22-cisco/email-triage-schema-drift/runs/5omalmor)*

### Before vs After — Episode Rewards Across 3 Schema Phases

![Before/After Fine-Tuning — x: episode (1→30), y: reward per episode](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/cyborg-joshi/email-triage-openenv-env/main/Before_after_finetuning.png)

*Episode-by-episode reward across all 3 schema phases. Red = Llama-3.3-70B base (no fine-tuning). Green = GRPO fine-tuned Llama-3.2-3B (LoRA). Reward drops at episodes 10 and 20 show schema drift kicking in — rules changed silently.*

### Key Result — GRPO Fine-Tuning Improves 3B Model by +14%

| Model | v1 Corporate | v2 Startup | v3 Executive | **Overall** |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Llama-3.2-3B (no training) | 0.301 | 0.303 | 0.415 | **0.340** |
| Llama-3.2-3B + GRPO fine-tuned | 0.346 | 0.385 | 0.435 | **0.389** |
| Llama-3.3-70B (no training) | 0.41 | 0.58 | 0.50 | **0.496** |

*GRPO fine-tuning improves the 3B model by **+14% overall** (+15% v1, +27% v2, +5% v3). The fine-tuned 3B model achieves **78% of the 70B baseline at 1/23rd the model size** — trained purely from the live environment's reward signal, no human labels.*

## What Makes This Environment Unique

### Schema Drift
Every 10 episodes the environment silently switches its active rule schema:

| Schema | Episodes | Priority | Tone | Max Reply |
|--------|----------|----------|------|-----------|
| v1 Corporate | 1–10 | Production alerts | Formal | 50 words |
| v2 Startup | 11–20 | Clients | Casual | 100 words |
| v3 Executive | 21+ | Legal / Revenue | Formal | 30 words |

The agent is never told the rules changed. It must figure it out from the rewards.

### Two-Step Episodes
Each episode has two steps — testing both decision-making and communication:
- **Step 1:** Choose an action — `reply`, `escalate`, `delegate`, `reschedule`, `ignore`
- **Step 2:** Write the actual reply (tone and length graded against current schema)

Reward is given only at the end of step 2 (delayed reward).

### Rich World State
The agent sees more than just an email:
```json
{
  "emails": ["ALERT: Checkout service is down. Revenue $8k/min."],
  "calendar": {"6pm": "Dad's retirement dinner — restaurant booked"},
  "pending_tasks": ["Reply to sales team by EOD"],
  "schema_version": "v1",
  "schema_name": "Corporate Mode",
  "context": "Friday evening. Production on fire. Dad's dinner in 2 hours."
}
```

---

## Reward Model

```
Total Reward = action_correctness (40%)
             + reply_quality      (40%)
             + conflict_awareness (20%)
```

- **Action correctness:** Did the agent pick the right action for the current schema? Partial credit for close actions.
- **Reply quality:** Keyword coverage + tone compliance + length within schema limit
- **Conflict awareness:** Did the reply acknowledge any scheduling conflict?

All rewards clamped to `[0.01, 0.99]`.

## Tasks (10 Scenarios)

| Task ID | Description | Schema Sensitive |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| `conflict_work` | Production emergency vs personal dinner | Yes |
| `conflict_calendar` | Double-booked appointments | Yes |
| `boss_pressure` | Angry boss demanding overdue report | Yes |
| `personal_event` | Friend's wedding with flight conflict | No |
| `spam_disguised` | Phishing email disguised as urgent | Yes |
| `legal_compliance` | Legal audit with strict deadline | Yes |
| `personal_family` | Family emergency, emotional response needed | No |
| `client_urgent` | Enterprise client threatening CEO escalation | Yes |
| `finance_pressure` | Overdue invoice needing delegation | No |
| `drift_detection` | Ideal action changes across all schemas | Yes |

## Training Pipeline

Fine-tuning uses **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)** from HuggingFace TRL + Unsloth:

- Base model: `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` (4-bit quantized via LoRA)
- The environment's reward function IS the training signal — no human labels, no reward model
- Training loop connects directly to the live HuggingFace Space via HTTP
- 50 training episodes, 3 epochs, LoRA on q_proj + v_proj

See the [Colab training notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gytu7Nlkm53UT1BN2_2fOFKcr-wNliQw?usp=sharing) to reproduce.

## Why This Matters

Most RL environments have fixed rules. Real-world tasks don't. A personal assistant deployed at a startup behaves differently than one deployed at a bank — and both behave differently from one working for an executive who switched industries last month.

Schema drift is a proxy for **distribution shift in deployed AI systems** — the thing that causes production models to silently degrade. This environment forces the agent to detect and adapt, which is closer to the real problem than any static benchmark.
